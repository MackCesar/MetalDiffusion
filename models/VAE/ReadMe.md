### VAE Models

Place your VAE .ckpt files here.

VAE stands for **V**ariational **A**uto**e**ncoder. The VAE encodes an image for the diffusion model to work with and then decodes the newly created image.

**NOTE**: This implementation of Stable Diffusion has the original VAE hard coded, so you don't need to include any extra VAE's.
